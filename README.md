# web_scrapping

## Introduction
Hi all, i hope you are doing well, this is a web scapping project using scrapy python. </br>
Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites.

## Getting started

In this section i'll show you how to extract articles informations from a site web, the [bbc news](https://www.bbc.com/news) in our case </br>
I used : </br>
>> Scrapy for crawling.</br>
>> MongoDB : for storing informations.</br>
>> Flask-Restful : to develop my restful API.</br>

You find two folders : </br>
 >> postscrape : that contains all file and configuration files for crawling the web site.</br>
 >> API : contains a phython script for a restful API to select information from a distant database ( MongoDB Atlas).</br>
 
 ## Tools and how to install  :

* **Flask** : *pip install flask*
* **Flask Restful** : *pip install flask-restful*
* **Pymongo** :   *pip install Flask-PyMongo*

* For **Scrapy** we enter :  *pip install scrapy*
